# PPI Greater Manchester Tech Stack Manifesto

This document/repository lists the technologies adopted by PPIGM. We keep track of things for handover and transition purposes between generations, and hopefully other Communities can adopt similar methods as us, apart from this Github Repository.

## SumUp PPIGM store (`store.ppigm.org`)
Online store powered by sumup. User credentials given to treasurer@ppigm.org, tech team needs to maintain domain renewal so that the store subdomain doesn't fall flat. Handover by providing login credentials

## Namecheap Domain Management Service
Most important asset. Used for domain and DNS management, email forwarding and aliases, etc. DO NOT EVER FORGET TO RENEW THE ppigm.org DOMAIN!. Handover by renewing domain, claiming reimbursement, and then passing ownership of the domain to the next Head of Tech. Head of Tech must then reset all emails. 

## PPIGM Link Shortener by Rebrandly
Link Shortener with form `link.ppigm.org` made by Rebrandly. Handover by providing login credentials.

## PPIGM Website (`www.ppigm.org`) hosted on Netlify.
Simple single page HTML website with a simple gallery and committee portraits, and a contact button in the end. Handover by providing access to Netlify Website. 

## PPIGM Handbook (`handbook.ppigm.org`) hosted on GitBook.
Simple Gitbook to be used as our handbook for Indonesian Students in Manchester

## PPIGM Blog (`blog.ppigm.org`) hosted on Netlify.
