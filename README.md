# PPI Greater Manchester Tech Stack Manifesto

This document/repository lists the technologies adopted by PPIGM. We keep track of things for handover and transition purposes between generations, and hopefully other Communities can adopt similar methods as us, apart from this Github Repository.

## Namecheap Domain Management Service
Most important asset. Used for domain and DNS management, email forwarding and aliases, etc. DO NOT EVER FORGET TO RENEW THE ppigm.org DOMAIN!

## PPIGM Website (`www.ppigm.org`) hosted on Netlify.
Simple single page HTML website with a simple gallery and committee portraits, and a contact button in the end

## PPIGM Handbook (`handbook.ppigm.org`) hosted on GitBook.
Simple Gitbook to be used as our handbook for Indonesian Students in Manchester

## PPIGM Blog (`blog.ppigm.org`) hosted on Netlify.
A Gatsby Website that accepts data from the Contentful CMS and delivers them as blogs. Builds a new website on publication of a new blog object by a Netlify Webhook
